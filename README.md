# IBM CALL FOR CODE 2019
Disaster management is one of the biggest problems economies face today, since natural calamities not only cause a lot of damage to development and property but they also cost a lot of lives. So, it thereby costs a lot of money to the economy to minimise all the damage caused by these natural disasters. Unfortunately, most of the technologies available today usually trigger a warning to the areas affected and send rescue teams only after the natural calamity has occured, therby within that short period of time lots of lives could have been affected and a lot of damage could have occured to developments and property. 

So our goal was come up with a project, which could predict the possibilty of a natural disaster like earthquakes and immediately trigger a warning to the areas which could be affected using historic data and today's data and also minimise the damage faced by the people who live in rural areas (who might not have much access to technology) unlike how people who live in the urban areas have.

In our project, we've used machine learning, weather APIs and the core technology is Python.

First, we collect the maximum amount of historic data as possible and come up with a curve of various constraints like latitude, altitude, temperature, humidity and many more which could indicate the favourable conditions for an earthquake. Then, this curve is compared with today's weather data. If there exists some correlation between these two curves, and if there is a possibilty of a natural disaster, it immediately triggers a warning to the areas which could be affected using the coordinates of latitude and longitude, otherwise it just goes on scanning the data as usual.

With this, the economy's GDP does not get affected too much, since every year billions of dollars are spent on disaster management. Also, many people who could be affected massively by these natural calamities can be saved.
